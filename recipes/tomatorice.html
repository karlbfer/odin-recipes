        <h2>Steps to Make tomato beefcubes over fried rice</h2>
        <li>
            <ol>Marinate the beef strips in the garlic, lemongrass, chilli, fish sauce and oyster sauce. Cover and refrigerate for 2 hours or overnight. </ol>
            <ol>Season the onion slices with salt and pepper and squeeze to extract a little of the onion juice. Place the onion in a small ceramic bowl and toss with the vinegar. Cover and refrigerate. </ol>
            <ol>To make the tomato red rice heat the oil in a wok over a high heat. Cook the garlic for 30 seconds or until just beginning to colour. Add the rice and toss for 1 minute. Add the tomato paste and fish sauce and toss over the heat for 4 minutes or until the rice is warmed through. Season with white pepper to taste. </ol>
            <ol>Continue cooking the shaking beef by heating a little of the rice bran oil in a wok over a high heat. Stir fry the beef in batches for 2 minutes tossing continuously and transfer to a plate. </ol>
            <ol>To serve plate the tomato red rice. Pile the Vietnamese shaking beef as a high pile on top of the rice. Mix the watercress, onion slices and vinegar together and serve a small ball of the watercress garnish on top of each serve of beef. Serve immediately. </ol>
