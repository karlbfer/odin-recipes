        <p>The hardest recipe of them all: grilled cheese!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>
            <ul>2 teaspoons unsalted butter, at room temperature </ul>
            <ul>2 slices soft white sandwich bread </ul>
            <ul>3 thin deli slices American cheese (about 1 1/2 oz.) </ul>
        </li>
        <h2>Steps to Make Grilled Cheese</h2>
        <li>
            <ol> Preheat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over medium-low heat. Spread 1 teaspoon butter onto one side of each bread slice.</ol>
            <ol>Place 1 bread slice buttered side down in the skillet. Top with the cheese and the second bread slice buttered side up. Cook for 2 minutes. Flip carefully using a wide metal spatula, then cook for 2 minutes more on the second side; the bread should be barely colored. Repeat, cooking for about 2 minutes more on each side, until golden. Cut in half and serve immediately.</ol>
